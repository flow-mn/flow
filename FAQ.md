## What is Flow?

Flow is a free and open-source personal finance tracking app. As Flow is offline,
you are in control of your data.

## Where do I download Flow?

You can download Flow from:

- App Store (to be released soon)
- [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/NH4ifijS) (iOS/macOS testing platform)
- [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mn.flow.flow)

## Can I export all of my data?

Yes, you can export JSON/ZIP backups which you can import it to another device, and CSV files for
analyzing your data in spreadsheet software (i.e., Excel, Google Sheets), which is not recoverable
like JSON/ZIP backups.

## Does Flow have online sync?

No. It's planned, and is likely to take quite some time. In the meantime, I recommend doing
periodic backups to avoid data loss.

## Will Flow have online sync?

Yes, it will. It's likely to take quite some time. In the meantime, I recommend doing
periodic backups to avoid data loss.

## Does Flow work offline?

Yes, Flow doesn't require internet except for gather exchange rates data.

Flow doesn't need exchange rates if you use only one currency.

## Does Flow support multi-currency

Yes. Flow can generate reports, summaries involving accounts with different
currency.

> Cross-currency transfers are not available at the moment.

## Can I make transfers between different currency accounts?

No, at the moment, it's not possible. This feature is planned, and is expected
to be out in the near future.

## Is Flow free?

Yes, Flow is absolutely free. All of the features are available for free
without any limitations.

Please consider supporting if you can as I make Flow on the side, and does not
generate money off of it ^^

aligns with Flow's vision, it will be implemented.

## Why is Flow free and/or open-source?

Many benefit from open source, including me. And this is my small contribution.
